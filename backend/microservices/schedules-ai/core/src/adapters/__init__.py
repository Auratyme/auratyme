"""
Adapters Package.

This package contains modules that act as adapters or interfaces to external
systems, services, or data sources. Examples include adapters for specific
wearable device APIs (Fitbit, Oura), RAG systems, external calendar services,
or databases.

The goal of adapters is to encapsulate the specifics of interacting with
external systems, providing a consistent interface to the core application logic.
